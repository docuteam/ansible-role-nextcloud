# available, either make the changes manually and then the oc_preferences table
# in your nextcloud database or use your browsers inspection tool to inspect the
# form element in the nextcloud admin interface that you want to change. Try to
# find the ng-model attribute of the <input> tag. It should be sth like
# 'settingsShowWeekNr'. The config name in this case will be 'showWeekNr'.
